# My personal website's code

Feel free to copy the design or use my code as guide to make your own site.

Details on the inner wokings:

* "_includes" folder:
<br>
- "shared-head.html" contains the shared headings and APIs to make sure everything works alright across the site.
- "footer.html" contains the html code for the footer
- The "header-(lang).html" files contain the header section corresponding to each language the site is available in (Currently only English and Spanish). The site title redirects to the main page.

<br>

* "_layouts" folder:
<br>
Each "layout" has a version for each language the site is available in.
