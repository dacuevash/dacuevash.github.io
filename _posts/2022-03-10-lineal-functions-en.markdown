A linear function represents a line when graphed onto a two-dimensional plane. There are three main forms to represent them:
<br/><br/>

### General form:
$$ Ax + By + C = 0 $$<br>
This form can be easily identified since it always equals to zero. $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$ are constants, $$A$$ and $$B$$ can
be zero but not at the same time. This equation doesn't really tell you much about the graph, so it's highly recommended to try to convert it to the
slope-intercept form by clearing $$y$$.
<br/><br/>

### Slope-intercept form:
$$y = mx + b$$ <br>
In this form $$m$$ represents the slope of the line; the slope is better defined as the change in the $$y$$ axis per
change in $$x$$ axis: $$∆y / ∆x$$; or by the equation: $$m = {y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1}$$ <br>
$$B$$ represents the point in which the line intercepts the
"y" axis, it can be found if you already know a point by which the line passes by plugging the "x", "y" and "m" values into the equation and then solving for "b". A positive slope value will result in the line going downwards while moving forward, and a negative slope will make it go upwards
while going upwards.
<br/><br/>

### Parametric form:
The parametric equations for a line look like this:, being "Xp" and "yp" the "x" and "y" values of a point by which the line passes. "Xv" and "yv" are the coordinates of a vector sunning on parallel to the line that can be found by finding the difference of two points A and B passing through
