I always used to hear kids in TV shows and movies say that they absolutely hated history, so I always assumed it'd be a horrible and troublesome class to take, and when the time to learn history finally arrived I found that statement to be kinda true. I had a very hard time trying to remember names, dates, places and other historical facts, you could say that the story didn't really resonate with me, I couldn't understand what was happening most of the time. 
<br><br>

It wasn't until middle school that I actually began to appreciate history more. For context, in elementary school I had to take Mexican history classes, and if you dear reader don't know about Mexican history, let's just say it's a miracle the country hasn't collapsed, so you can probably imagine it's a very complicated story. In middle school however, it was time to learn universal history, starting from the very beggining of humankind. My then teacher was very good at teaching, she made us read books, tales and novels set in the periods we were currently studying, she'd then go on to explain how the world used to work and how the world evolved from there to become what it is now. This made me feel much more connected to history, it wasn't just something that happened long ago that doesn't matter anymore, it's the story of how the world in which I live in came to be. 
<br><br>

With this in mind I began to see history in the same way I see the lore of a movie/TV show/book/videogame franchise, those are very interesting stories you just want to know more about because you're currrently living in that world. The real world can be complicated, messy, dumb and even very depressing at times, but it's that curiosity of knowing why the world is like that right now that fuels me to learn more about the past. Learning the story behind the World Wars is just as interesting as knowing what led to the Galactic Civil War, there are characters with different motivations and goals and valuable lessons to be learned.
<br><br>

I think there's something fundamentally wrong with the way history is taught, back in elementary school history was something you just didn't care about, not because it wasn't interesting but because you had no context at all about how the world around you works. Now as an adult I'm very eager to learn about all the sh*t Mexico has gone through to try to make sense of all the sh*t we still go through today. 
<br><br>

In conclusion, history is the lore of the very weird but interesting world in which we live in today, and to know where to go next, we must know what came before, to avoid messing up the same way someone probably did in the past.
