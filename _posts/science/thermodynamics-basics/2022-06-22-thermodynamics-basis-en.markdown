The word "Thermodynamics" itself literally means "The dynamics of heat", but that's kind of a half-assed definition so let's try the following one that my first semester physics professor told me: "It's the science that deals with fenomena related to the tranformation and exchange of energy and related properties of substances", now that sounds better but if you want a truly solid definition here's what Wikipedia says: "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation.", that sounds more professional. 
<br><br>

Thermodynamics has 4 basic laws: <br>
* **Law Zero:** If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
* **First Law:** In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, minus the thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings.
* **Second Law:** Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter.
* **Third Law:** As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.
<br><br>

Regardless of which definition you choose to write on your homework, the most important thing you must remember about thermodynamics is that it deals with energy, heat and temperature. Heat is a kind of energy that appears when there's an interaction between two bodies at different temperatures and is measured in [J] Joules; for instance, a hot body that is in contact with a cold one will transfer energy in the form of heat to the cold one to reach a thermal balance bewtween the two bodies. It's a basic rule of the Universe that objects with energy want to get rid of that energy and be at the lowest posibble energetic state, so energy will try to flow into environments of less energy to try to balance the energetic state of the system. 
<br><br>

Heat exchange happens via the following methods: **conduction**, which happens among solids; **convection**, among fluids; and via **radiation** when there's no physical medium by which heat can be transfered (the vacuum of space, for example).
<br><br>

Temperature doesn't really measure heat, it measures the molecuar -internal- energy of an object, which is the sum of the cinetic energy of the particles that make up the object. Solid and liquid molecules usually vibrate while gaseous molecules crash with each other. 
<br><br>

A thermodynamic system is the set of bodies of matter and/or radiation existing within an enclosed area of space in which the matter/energy variables of said bodies can be studied. <- That's the best definition I could come up with. There are **isolated** thermodynamic systems which as its name implies, its limits cannot be crossed by either mass and/or energy. **Closed** systems are those whose limits can only be crossed by flows of energy, not mass. **Open** systems can exchange both mass and energy with the outer environment.

Now, onto some more practical stuff:
<br><br>

The heat capacity of a body, denoted as $$C$$, is its capacity to store heat. Its formula is: <br>
$$ {\Delta Q \over \Delta T} $$ and its unit is: [J/K] (Joules over Kelvins). 
<br><br>

Meanwhile, the **specific** heat capacity of a body, denoted as $$ c_p $$, is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature by one degree per unit of mass. Its formula is: <br>
$$ {C \over m} $$ and its unit is: [J/Kg·K] (Joules over Kilogram times kelvin). It's important to note that it doesn't necessarily have to be Kelvins, one degree is technically the same in the Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, so don't worry about having to convert scales when talking about $$ c_p $$.
<br><br>

The basic formula you can use to calculate heat exchange between two bodies is: <br>
$$ \Delta Q = m·c_p·\Delta T $$, where $$ Q $$ represents heart or energy, $$ m $$ is mass and $$ T $$ is temperature.
