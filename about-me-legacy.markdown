Hello! My name is Diego Cuevas, I'm an engineering student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I made this website as a place to write about the stuff I learn in college and other interesting information that might be useful for someone else or even for myself in the near future when I've inevitably forgotten most of it. 
<br/><br/>

There's also a Spanish version of this website (of course), click on the globe icon and choose the language you prefer.
<br/><br/>

This website was created using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you're curious about the design or how the website works,
you can visit the public [repository][website-repository]. This is the first website I've ever made so I'm sorry if it looks bad or
too "meh". I will definitely continue to upgrade the design and add more features as I learn more about web development.
<br/><br/>

My contact information is available in the footer of the website at all times. Feel free to contact me if you've got any issues, suggestions, inquiries, comments, death threats or whatever.
<br/><br/>
