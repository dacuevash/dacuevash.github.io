Hello! My name is Diego Cuevas and I run this website. I'm an 18 year old engineering student at UNAM, Mexico.
I love science, technology, art, music, history and philosophy so I decided to create this website as an outlet for my thoughts,
ideas and likes which I seldom have the opportunity to share with other people since I'm a bit introverted in real life. I write articles about topics I find interesting in a wide variety of subjects, so don't feel weirded out if you see an article about Mexican history and then one about which Star Wars starfighter is better.
<br/><br/>

Yeah I'm a nerd ðŸ™ƒ.
<br/><br/>

This website was created using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you're curious about the design or how the website works,
you can visit the public [repository][website-repository]. This is the first website I've ever programmed/designed so sorry if it looks bad or
too "meh". I will definitely continue to upgrade the design and add more features as I learn more about web development.
<br/><br/>

I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, so this website also has an Spanish version with the exact same articles and posts.
I love language learning so hopefully if I become really good at speaking another language I'll add a version of the website in that language to further expand my audience.
<br/><br/>

My contact information is available in the footer of the website at all times. Feel free to contact me if you've got any issues, suggestions, inquiries or just want to tell me something.
