Hello! My name is Diego Cuevas and I run this website. I'm an 18 year old engineering student at UNAM, Mexico.
I love science, technology, art, music, history and philosophy so I decided to create this website as an outlet for my thoughts,
ideas and likes which I seldom have the opportunity to share with other people since I'm a bit introverted in real life. Sometimes I also write tutorials on certain topics I come across while studying and find interesting enough to try to
teach to other people.
<br/><br/>
I am a passionate science-fiction fan, specially franshises such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Mobile Suit Gundam, Evangelion,
Godzilla, Marvel and DC, etc. I also really like anime and manga, you can find me on MyAnimeList
[here][MyAnimeList-profile]. If you're curious about what kind of music I like here's my [Apple Music profile][apple-music-profile] too.
<br/><br/>
Yeah I'm a nerd ðŸ™ƒ.
<br/><br/>
I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, so this website also has an Spanish version. I'm currently learning Japanese and hope that
in the future I can start writing some posts in Japanese as well.
<br/><br/>
My contact information is available in the footer of the website at all times.
