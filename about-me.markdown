Hello! My name is Diego Cuevas and I run this website. I'm an 18 year old engineering student at UNAM, Mexico.
I love science, technology, art, history and philosophy so I decided to create this website as an outlet for my thoughts,
ideas and likes which I seldom have the opportunity to share with other people since I'm a bit introverted in real life.
<br/><br/>
Sometimes I also write tutorials on certain topics I come across while studying and find interesting enough to try to
teach to other people.
<br/><br/>
I am fluent in both English and Spanish, so this website also has an Spanish version. I'm currently learning Japanese and hope that
in the future I can start writing some posts in Japanese as well.
<br/><br/>
My contact information is available in the footer of the website at all times.
