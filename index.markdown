Hello, my name is Diego Cuevas, I'm a 20 year old college student from Mexico City currently enrolled at UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) studying aerospace engineering.

<br>

I have a vast array of interests, mainly those that relate to science and technology. I am decently good at maths, I love physics and I am quite fascinated with computers and machines. However, I'm not all left-brained, I'm also an amateur photographer.

<br>

I hope this serves as a basic introduction to who I am, and if you want to get to know me better, by all means reach out to me ðŸ˜ƒ
