Hello, my name is Diego Cuevas, I'm a 20 year old college student from Mexico City currently enrolled at UNAM's School of Engineering, majoring in aerospace engineering.

<br>

This is my personal website, in the upper menu you'll find different sections of this website:

<br>

1. My project portfolio
2. Blog posts about mostly random things

<br>

There may or may not be more sections in the future, stay tunned anyways!

<br>

This website was created using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can visit the public [repository][website-repository].

My contact information is available at the bottom of the website at all times.
